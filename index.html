        <p>In Part 1, we started working on our first enemy, Springtrap.</p>
        <img src="img/springtrap.jpg" alt="Springtrap sprite">
        <p>
          We have created the animations that the <span>Animator Controller</span> will use for
          Springtrap. Now we need to tell the <span>Animator Controller</span> when to play each
          animation.
        </p>

        <h2>Building the Animator Controller</h2>
        <p>
          Open the Springtrap <span>Animator Controller</span> that we created previously
          <span>(Assets > Prefabs > Enemies > Animations)</span> in the
          <span>Animator window</span>. In addition to the <span>Any State</span>,
          <span>Entry</span>, and <span>Exit blocks</span>, we should see two other
          blocks for the walking and death animations we created last time.
        </p>
        <img src="img/animator-view.jpg" alt="The animation state machine for Springtrap">
        <h3>Walking Animation</h3>
        <p>
          By default, the <span>Animation State Machine</span> (the graph) has the walking animation
          linked to <span>Entry</span>. This means that the walking animation will play
          when the game starts, which is what we want.
        </p>
        <p>
          (If the walking animation is not linked to <span>Entry</span>by default, right-click the
          walking animation and select <span>Set as Layer Default State</span>.)
        </p>
        <h3>Death Animation</h3>
        <p>We also want Springtrap's death animation to play when he dies.</p>
        <p>
          We do this by adding a transition between the walking animation and
          the death animation, then assigning a trigger to the transition.
        </p>
        <p>First, right-click the walking animation and select Make Transition.</p>
        <img src="img/make-transition.jpg" alt="Selecting the Make Transition option">
        <p>
          A white arrow that follows your cursor should appear. Click on
          the death animation to link the two animations together.
        </p>
        <img src="img/make-transition2.jpg" alt="Transition between the death and walking animations">
        <p>
          Click the drop-down next to the plus sign in the parameters tab.
          Select <span>Trigger</span>. Name this trigger “Die.”
